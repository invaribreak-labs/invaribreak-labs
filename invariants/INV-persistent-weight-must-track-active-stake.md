Invariant

A participant with no active stake must not retain any persistent reward weight.

Rationale

Persistent weight is used to allocate future rewards.
Any residual weight without backing capital represents unearned influence over distribution.

Violation Condition

Stake principal is fully withdrawn.

Persistent weight remains non-zero.

Systemic Consequence

Reward allocation becomes manipulable.

Capital efficiency assumptions collapse.

Honest participation is economically penalized.
