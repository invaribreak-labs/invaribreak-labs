# Exploit Path  
## Epoch-Gated Weight Retention

This exploit path describes a lawful sequence of protocol interactions
that allows persistent reward weight to be retained after stake exit,
due to epoch-gated state cleanup.

This path instantiates the following pattern:

→ ../patterns/persistent-weight-not-cleared-on-exit.md


Preconditions

Persistent reward weight is used for reward allocation

State cleanup logic is conditional on epoch or accounting window alignment

Users can stake and unstake permissionlessly

No privileged roles are required

Execution Path

Stake assets to acquire persistent reward weight

Allow the stake to mature beyond the active accounting window

Exit the full stake position

Persistent reward weight is not removed

Repeat the cycle to accumulate retained weight

Lawfulness

All actions invoke standard protocol functions

No invalid state transitions are triggered

No reliance on reentrancy, race conditions, or undefined behavior

Resulting Effect

Persistent weight becomes unbacked by active capital

Reward allocation favors exited participants

Economic incentives diverge from intended design
